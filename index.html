    Corporate Power

<!--  beginning of our background paragraph  -->
  <h2>
    Maintaining accountability within the digital world.
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Introduction
  </h3>
  <p>
  With an ever growing internet, comes the potential for ever growing corporate overstep into the digital world. Blablaa (insert better introduction here). 
  Therefore we sought to find a way to manage this relationship and protect the rights of users while giving clear guidelines to corporations to maintain responsibility (idk add snazzy zinger here test).
  Before we can determine how corporations fit within the digital rights space we have to first set clear definitions for what Power and Corporate Power are. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    What Is Corporate Power?
  </h3>
  <p>
    As we believe that digital rights spawn from the fundamental rights written within the UDHR, we believe that the best basis for our work would be one that focuses on corporate power within this offline space. 
    Thus we chose (insert his first name) Birchall’s 2011 (Check this) Corporate responsibility framework(double check naming convention) as the foundation to our work. 
    In his framework, Birchall states that the definition of power is “The production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate”. 
    (insert some analysis or extra sentences here). He continues his definition of Corporate Power as follows: “The production, by business enterprises, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of individuals to enjoy their human rights.” 
    We can take from this that Corporate Power boils down to how corporations influence and control human rights. (insert some analysis). We have thus taken the framework described by Birchall and have separated it into the following 4 sections.
